      Learned cardinalities: Estimating correlated joins with deep learning.
      9th Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR â€˜19), CA,
      USA. https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00677

      "JOB-scale" contains 500 queries with 0-4 joins (100 queries each).
      It is used by Kipf et al. (2019) to test whether the Multi-Set Convolutional
      Network (MSCN) can generalize to queries with more joins than it was trained
      on. MSCN was trained using queries that had 0-2 joins.
